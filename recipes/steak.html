        <strong>Description:</strong>
        Steak is marinated in the fridge for 45 minutes, then quickly pan-seared in a cast iron skillet before it is finished in the oven.    <br />
    <strong>Ingredients: </strong>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (6 ounce) beef top sirloin steaks</li>
        <li>2 cups orange juice</li>
        <li>1 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>½ cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons steak seasoning (such as Fiesta Brand Uncle Chris'), or to taste        </li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        <li>sea salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Place steaks side by side in large casserole dish. Add orange juice, cider vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce.</li>
        <li>Marinate, uncovered, in the refrigerator for 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove casserole dish from refrigerator. Cover steaks with plastic wrap and let allow to come to room temperature, at least 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place steaks on a clean work surface and generously rub with steak seasoning and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a cast-iron skillet over high heat.</li>
        <li>Cook steaks in the hot skillet until lightly browned on the bottom, 2 ½ minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip and cook until browned on the other side and red in the center, about 2 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Transfer skillet with the steaks to the oven.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until steaks are firm and reddish-pink to lightly pink in the center, 8 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read from 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) to 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove steaks from oven; season with salt. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
